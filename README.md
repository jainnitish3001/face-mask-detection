# UCS757 : Building Innovative Systems
# PROJECT 2 : Face Mask detection
## Introduction :

I have used CNN to differentiate between people wearing mask and people not wearing mask.
An accuracy of 98.2% on the training set and 97.3% on the test set is achieved.

I trained the model and used HDF5 file to store the model weights.

## Following are the libraries required: 
Python, Numpy,Pillow,Tensorflow
